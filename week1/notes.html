</header>
<body>
    <h2>Rewire your brain for mobile first</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Responsive Retrofitting is taking what you have already and making it work on mobile. The pros are: its cheaper,faster than ground rewrite. Results in better mobile experience than only desktop. The cons are: it doesn't address screen real estate and touch interaction issues.</li>
        <li>Mobile First is going mobile to desktop.The cons are: time-consuming, costly for full rebuild. The pros: best experience across many devices, deals with constraints for size/bandwith, future-friendly, adaptable/growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Desktop sales have been in decline for the past decade, people are on their phones not their labtops, start small & scale up, Mobile is sticking around for awhile</p>
    <h2>Improve UX through Users</h2>
    <p>Know the users better than themselves. Focus less on what they say and more on what they are doing.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Be there: Users expect you to be there to help them.</li>
        <li>Be useful: Don't make users hunt for what they want.</li>
        <li>Be quick: Avoid excessive steps causing user frustration.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Reachability is making sure key items are in easy to reach places.</p>
    <p>Boost speed by:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Reducing image usage</li>
    <li>Use SVG's & Webfonts</li>
    <li>Optimize & Minify CSS and JS files</li>
    <li>GZIP (compress those files) to remove extras</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Use Strategic Menu designs</h2>
    <p>Put primary controls and menu at the bottom</p>
    <p>If you can place things correctly you can fix & improve reachability, speed, engagement & user satisfaction.</p>
    <h2>Mobile forms</h2>
    <p>The easier you make user input the longer you keep users happy and on your app.</p>
    <h2>Mobile advertising</h2>
    <ul><li>People don't go to visit websites to look at ads!</li>
        <li>Don't use pop-up ads!!</li>
        <li>Always focus on content first.</li>
        <li>Keep things simple and sleek.</li>
    </ul>
